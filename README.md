## About:
Roulette wheel game is a project developed in the second semester of a IT course on Colégio Técnico de Campinas - Unicamp. It consists of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** made in **C#** and allowed me to review how to manipulate arrays. 

## How does the game work?
- Basically, you will need to spin the roulette to get a secret word (available in an array with words) and guess it based on the hint (another array).

- If you guess the word correctly, you win the game.
